# Privacy Policy for DnD Game Rolls

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

## Overview

DnD Game Rolls is a desktop application for rolling dice and managing D&D character sheets. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal information.**

DnD Game Rolls is a standalone desktop application that:

- Does **not** use analytics, telemetry, or tracking
- Does **not** require user registration or accounts
- Does **not** transmit your character data or settings anywhere

The app may make a network request to GitHub to fetch the public contributors list (and optionally download public avatar images) for the Contributors screen.

## Local Data Storage

The only data stored by this application is:

- **Character data** - Stored locally on your computer (in a SQLite database for the 3D app, and/or as `.json` files when using file-based flows).

- **Application settings** - Stored locally on your device (in SQLite; older installs may have a legacy `settings.json` that is migrated).

All character data and settings remain entirely on your computer and are never transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

DnD Game Rolls does **not** use analytics or cloud storage.

The Contributors screen may call the public GitHub API and fetch public avatar images.

## Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no special considerations for children's data. The application is suitable for users of all ages.
